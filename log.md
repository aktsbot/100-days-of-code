# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: June 10, 2018

Started working on [fu](https://github.com/aktsbot/fu), which is a tiny file upload api written in node.

## Day 2: June 11, 2018

- Got `git-flow` on the fu repo. A `$ sudo apt install git-flow` and a `$ git flow init` is all that it takes.
- Revisit [Docker Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/docker-mastery/learn/v4/overview) and get comfortable with docker. We're gonna move fu to docker soon.
